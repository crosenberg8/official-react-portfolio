    summary: "The point of this project was to test my UI development skills. I learned how to create GUIs in an object oriented programming course here at tech (it was one of the final modules of the course), and I applied all of the skills I learned to make this program. It is a password generator, with a few settings that I can toggle to tailor the password that is generated to my liking.",
