I used HTML and CSS for the front end of the website, and used JS to handle the contact me page of the website. This was my first ever web development project, which I did as a test to see if I have mastered the basics of web development. All of these skills were self taught by the way!",

    summary: "The point of this website was to test my backend development skills. After completing my basic front-end portfolio website, I decided to learn how to work on the back-end of websites (the server side of things). For this project, I taught myself the basics of Git/GitHub, Node JS, and Heroku web hosting. For Node, we used a few packages in order to make the hosting/creation of this website easier, some of them being Express, LoDash, Body Parser, and more. In the end, I was able to create a website where the website is processed on the backend of things, rather than the front-end of things with the browser. This was a “stepping stone project”, for my next one, which will be a website that combines the front-end AND back-end technologies I have taught myself to create a dynamic and fast portfolio website!",

    summary: "MUTR was my first attempt at a tech-startup, which had the goal to innovate upon commercial trucking and transportation. Our goal was to implement an easy-to-use highway-rail system that will allow tractor trailers to travel further, faster, eco-friendlier, and safer! After designing, testing, and validating various aspects of this project, we came to the unfortunate conclusion that, while the idea was indeed revolutionary, it simply needed too much capital in order to be built, and there were a significant number of legal barriers that would have added too much friction to the progress of the project if we decided to move forward. I was the founder, and creator of the group and also idea, and led a team of 8 individuals. I split the main team into hardware, software, and media sub-teams, which I did to divide and conquer tasks, as well as give my team mates the chance to get more involved and learn about leadership along the way.",

    summary: "The Rising Entrepreneur Society at Georgia Tech (RES@GT) is an entrepreneurship club focused on educating the Georgia Tech community in entrepreneurship and helping students build a solid foundation for their future as entrepreneurs through hands-on experiences and speaker series. One of the key aspects of our club is the Fall Bootcamp, where students are placed into groups and tasked with creating a meaningful product from the ground up. These teams are led by professional mentors who act as a guiding resource while also directly helping students build their entrepreneurial skills. Another important aspect of our club is our Speaker Series, where we invite founders and venture capitalists to talk about their experiences with entrepreneurship and enlighten students about what it takes to create an effective startup. The RES was formed in the Fall of 2020, and I was among the first of its members. I loved actively participating in club activities, hearing the various speakers, and learning about all the fascinating things there is to know about entrepreneurship.",
